Technical task.

The only issue I encountered is the dummy api endpoint doesn't have a filter query by Brand. 
If neccessary I can filter the table data with ```javascript .filter() ```

## Project Setup

Before start make sure you are using Node v18. I suggest a node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Install dependencies using yarn

```sh
yarn install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
yarn test:unit
```
